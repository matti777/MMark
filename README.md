# About

MMark was my ambitious cross-platform mobile graphics performance measuring app. It ran on iOS and Tizen as native builds and on Android, Blackberry and Desktop (win/linux/macos) as a Qt build.

It includes a simple Python backend for receiving and displaying high scores.

It depends on this project https://github.com/matti777/CommonGL

It is now abandonware.

It bundles some 3rd libraries as source, [hopefully] respecting their licenses:
